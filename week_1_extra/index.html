                    <p>I’m an enthusiastic software engineer that strives to create high quality and highly maintainable software that meets the requirements of the end user. I strongly believe that the best software is software that people want to use, rather than are forced to use.</p>
                    <p>I take pride in making the jobs of others easier, in enabling people to focus on the more interesting aspects of their job and in teaching others the lessons I’ve learned.</p>
                    <p>In the past few years I’ve seen the benefits of having a more structured development process with well-defined procedures to follow, I’ve also helped to document and implement some of these processes. I’ve developed an interest in accelerating the adoption of these processes and helping the technical team understand, not only what the processes / procedures are, but why we have them and why we should be following them. I also strongly believe that we should be using all the available tools to support and reinforce our processes / procedures as this will lead to an increase in productivity and a reduction in the amount of rework that is currently carried out over a project’s lifetime.</p>
                    <p>I understand that managing people may not always be a ‘fun’ task, but I have observed that guiding team members to a higher level can be very rewarding. Working with our student placements for example and seeing them take the various lessons on board and grow into better engineers with a greater understanding that it’s not just about doing the work but being proud of what they’ve accomplished, has been a pleasure. A pleasure that I can see far outweighing the less gratifying parts of leading a team.</p>
                    <p>I have a solid working knowledge of the principles behind the sensor technologies currently employed in Apollo’s various ranges of fire detectors. Over the past 22 years I’ve worked with most of the products Apollo manufacture. From 2006 onwards, I’ve helped to handle and resolve field issues, either by debugging hardware or by writing new software tools to help reproduce specific hypothetical scenarios that could potentially trigger the observed / reported symptoms.</p>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Represented Apollo in meetings with various external parties, including: Samsung, Advanced, BRE, UL, Texecom, Thales, Minimax and numerous others.</li>
                                <li>Built up a reputation within Apollo as someone that can help, examples include:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Often asked for advice by Development, Warranty, Product Support, Sales Managers, Product Managers, Test Engineering and the Systems Team amongst others.</li>
                                        <li>I was approached by HR to help fix some problems with their talent management spreadsheet.</li>
                                        <li>My manager has asked me on multiple occasions for my take on the history of Apollo’s devices to help better understand how we’ve arrived where we are.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Carry out protocol training sessions with new members of Apollo that require it.</li>
                                <li>Helped to mentor and guide student placements within the technical department, two of which were subsequently offered full time positions within Apollo.</li>
                                <li>Learned how to program in C# using the SimSys2 PC software as a worked example, having had no prior experience with the language.</li>
                                <li>Took over the SimSys 2 PC Software development shortly after having learned the language. Improvements to the project include:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Major architectural changes to make the code base more modular.</li>
                                        <li>Added unit tests to define and prove the implementation of the new code modules. There are currently > 3000 unit tests in the project, and adding new tests when bugs are fixed / new features implemented is now just part of the normal development process.</li>
                                        <li>Pioneered the use of Jira help ensure that bugs, new features, etc could be tracked and allocated to specific releases.</li>
                                        <li>Implemented new workflows within Jira to ensure that standard development and review processes could be defined and enforced.</li>
                                        <li>Developed a branching and merging strategy, using SVN, to ensure that conflicts introduced by working in parallel with other team members were kept to a minimum.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Extended the usage of the procedures developed as part of the SimSys 2 project to other software-based projects such as the SLIU 3/4 PC software and the firmware for the China Tier 2 devices.</li>
                                <li>Was part of the team that defined the China T2 protocol
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Designed and implemented an encoding / encryption scheme to help protect the new protocol from counterfeiting.
                                        <li>Worked with Thales to evaluate the encoding / encryption scheme and developed plans to make the scheme more robust in the future.
                                        <li>Used the lesson’s learned from Core Protocol to create a much simpler message structure with additional capabilities.
                                        <li>Generated documentation and tools to help verify the encoding / encryption processes.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Worked as part of the team that took the SLIU4 from concept to fully functional prototype. This work included elements of hardware, firmware, driver and PC software design.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Part of the work included mentoring our electronics placement student, specifically on the PC software development side of things.</li>

                                <li>Worked as part of a team with my fellow validation engineer to improve the reliability and capability of the SLIU3 test equipment with my primary contribution being to the ActiveX driver and the software tools side of things.</li>
                                <li>Was part of the team that defined how the Core extensions to the Apollo Protocol would work</li>
                                <li>Added Core Protocol support to the SLIU3 driver and software tools, without which development of many of the new products would not have been possible.</li>
                                <li>Introduced automated testing tools that are still in use by Apollo, approval bodies, select customers and 3rd parties that design and manufacture products for use on fire systems that implement the Apollo protocols.</li>
                                <li>Used my knowledge of VB6, and the available documentation, to write a test harness for the ALM2 product. This tool was subsequently used:

                    <p>I find reading to be a great way to relax and also a fantastic way to learn about new subjects. My favourite genres include science fiction and fantasy novels. I'm also partial to books that can shed more light on other subjects that I find interesting such as wildlife, computing and photography.</p>
                    <p>Having used computers since my early school days I'm extremely comfortable with them and find them to be an interesting subject in their own right. I set up and ran my own network of 4-5 computers as a way of sharing a single internet connection with my family but also as a way of finding out and learning more on the subject. On the network server, I built and configured, I supplied email (with spam filtering), web hosting and shell account services to several family members as well as to a few close friends.</p>
                    <p>As well as keeping my mind active I also like to keep in shape and find that running and training at the gym compliment the day to day desk work very nicely. In 2005 I successfully took part in and completed the London to Brighton bike ride in a time of three and a half hours. In 2016 I ran my first marathon in a time of 4:45, however my preferred distances are in the 5k to 10-mile bracket.</p>
